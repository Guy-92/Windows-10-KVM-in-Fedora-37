# Windows 10 KVM in Fedora 37

This repository contains a guide of what I did to get a Windows 10 Virtual Machine with GPU Passthrough runnning with Virt-Manager, and my XML. My issue was a message that said "This NVIDIA graphics driver is not compatible with this verison of Windows." When trying to install the NVIDIA drivers.
